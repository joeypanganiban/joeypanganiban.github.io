            <h2>Oriental Mindoro</h2>
            <p>
                Oriental Mindoro (Tagalog: Silangang Mindoro: Ilocano: Amianan nga Mindoro; 
                Hiligaynon: Sidlanganong Mindoro; Spanish: Mindoro Oriental) is a province in 
                the Philippines located on the island of Mindoro under Mimaropa region in Luzon, 
                about 140 kilometres (87 mi) southwest of Manila. The province is bordered by the 
                Verde Island Passage and the rest of Batangas to the north, by Marinduque, 
                Maestre de Campo (or known as Sibale but official name is Concepcion) Island, 
                Tablas Strait and the rest of Romblon to the east, by Semirara and the rest of 
                Caluya Islands, Antique to the south, and by Occidental Mindoro to the west. 
                Calapan, the only city in the island, is the provincial capital.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oriental Mindoro is touted as the country's emerging eco-tourism destination. 
                In 2005, the Philippines was found to be the center of marine fish biodiversity 
                and the home of the most diverse marine ecosystem in the world, by American 
                biologists Kent Carpenter and Victor Springer. Most of the endemic species in 
                the Philippines are found in the Verde Island Passage between Mindoro island 
                and the main island of Luzon. The passage houses 2,983 individual species of 
                algae, corals, crustaceans, mollusks, fishes, marine reptiles, and marine mammals, 
                based on a study conducted by Carpenter and Springer in 2005.
            </p>
            <p>
                UNESCO declared Puerto Galera a biosphere reserve under its Man and the Biosphere 
                Programme in the 1970s. The Verde Island Passage is at the apex of the so-called 
                Coral Triangle – the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia – which has the 
                distinction of being the "center of the center of the world's marine 
                biodiversity" and the "center of the center of marine shorefish biodiversity".

            <h3>History</h3>
            <h4>World War II</h4>
            <p>
                A Japanese force landed on northeastern Mindoro in the Philippine Islands on 
                27 February 1942
            </p>
            <p>
                Almost three years later, after the invasion of Mindoro by Allied forces, they 
                proceeded to land to Bongabong and heading to and capturing Calapan, the capital 
                of the united Mindoro Province at the time on 24 January 1945.
            <h4>Creation</h4>
            <p>
                After World War II, reconstruction and rehabilitation of infrastructure and 
                economy took place on the island, which then constituted a single province. This 
                was partitioned on 13 June 1950 into Oriental Mindoro and Occidental Mindoro 
                by virtue of Republic Act No. 505.

            <h3>Economy</h3>
            <p>
                Oriental Mindoro's rich and arable land is suitable for agriculture. It 
                produces large quantities of rice, corn, coconut, vegetables and fruits like 
                calamansi, banana, rambutan, marang or uloy, lanzones and durian. For that, 
                Oriental Mindoro is also known as the Rice Granary and Fruit Basket of Southern 
                Tagalog. It still is the Banana King and Calamansi King of the region. Its total 
                agricultural area is 169,603.34 hectares (419,099.0 acres). Based on 
                agricultural statistics, 85,244 hectares (210,640 acres) are devoted to palay 
                production while 21,671 hectares (53,550 acres)s to coconut plantation. For 
                2019, the province has been one of the top producers of rice becoming a source 
                of rice for the National Food Authority's rice procurement target.

            <h3>Tourist attractions</h3>
            <p>
                Access from Luzon via the Batangas ports mostly goes through the Verde Island 
                Passage to reach Puerto Galera, the key entry point to Oriental Mindoro. In 
                November 2004, Puerto Galera was voted a member of the UNESCO-affiliated 
                ‘The Club of the Most Beautiful Bays in the World. Puerto Galera features a 
                natural harbor which also protects ships, yachts and bancas from strong typhoons 
                sweeping in from the Pacific.
            </p>
            <p>
                Puerto Galera, known for white sand beaches and the accompanying honky tonk bar 
                scene on some key beaches, is known for its dive sites with a biodiversity of 
                marine life in and around the coral reefs. Underwater rock formations and coral 
                gardens are home to a variety of marine life, which include numerous species of 
                nudibranch, mantis shrimp, sea anemone, moray and sea fan sea horses. The seas 
                off the coast are host to passing dolphin pods and even the rarer whale shark, 
                and are part of the migratory small whale route from the Visayas.
            </p>
                Towering 8,488 feet (2,587 m) above sea level, Mount Halcon in Baco, is a popular 
                mountain climbing destination. Local and migratory birds allow birdwatching 
                activities. The province is home to endemic wildlife like the tamaraw, a 
                straight-horned water buffalo.
